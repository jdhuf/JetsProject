### Lessons Learned

This was a very challenging project for me, but it was rewarding. I was able to better understand how files work together in a program and the rules for accessing data from one file to another as well as within a file.

After doing this project, I feel more comfortable with using methods. I am also learning what to expect from Java regarding scope. 

I got a lot of practice with using methods of an arrayList in this project. 

Overall, this was a good project for me to improve my understanding of basic concepts in Java programming.
